It is an easy process which we will done using pip. Assuming it is installed just run the following.

# Source Code 

PyDriller's git repo is available on GitHub, which can be browsed at "https://github.com/ishepard/pydriller"

Clone it using the following commands 

"git clone https://github.com/ishepard/pydriller" after this 

"cd pydriller"

Then use the virtualenv using the following commands : 

"virtualenv -p python3 venv"
"source venv/bin/activate"

Then installing the requirements using the following commands : 

"pip install -r requirements" and 

"unzip test-repos.zip"

Finally, run the test using pytes command as follows : 

"pytest" 

If PyDriller is already installed in your system please upgrade using the following command :

"python -m pip install -â€“upgrade pip" please don't forget to restart the editor, to avoid any error. 

You can check the version of the pip by.

"pip --version" command. 

Once installing PyDrill is successfully completed pleae follow the steps to import the project from GitHub and run it. 

To import a file from GitHub to Pycharm, we can follow the process as same as IntelliJ IDEA that I explained or follwo the step as bellow :

First, copy the URL of GitHub then go to the Pycharm click on "VCC" and "Get from Version Control" .

After clicking on the "Get from Version Control" icon a empty URL box will appeared there past the coppied URL and press enter or clone.

The Pycharm will automatically download the project safely and all cecessary build files.

*** When the GitHub repogitory file imported safely, we need to add a librarie to be compatible with Pycharm and PyDrill.

To do it, pleas go to the "File" in Pycharm and settings. In the setting chose "Project" and "Python Interpreter".

After clicking "Python Interpreter" you will see a "+" icon if you click on it you will see a search button.

In the search button write "PyDriller" and install "PyDriller" by chosing "Install Package" option.

When installation successfully completed close the search page and select "PyDriller" by clicking on the "Ok" button the adding library process finished.

Now go to the project, and open the "RepositoryMiningStep_01.py" main file. 

If you can see any error put your mouse carsoe at pydriller which exists at the first line like " from pydriller import RepositoryMining".

If you keep your mouse coursor on it will show include pydriller please include it by clicking. 

It will take a little time and include the pydrill to your project. 

Finally, run the project py choseing run button. 

                                                                        "THANK YOU SO MUCH"....!!!!
